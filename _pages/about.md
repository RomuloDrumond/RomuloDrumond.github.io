Hi there! I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer exploring the transition into a Research Engineer role, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). My professional journey includes experience as a Data Engineer and Data Scientist, reflecting my passion for understanding and improving the entire pipeline of data-driven products. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> to learn more about my career path.

People who get to know me personally know that I am a nerd who can spend hours in front of the computer but know the importance of being sociable, that there is a time to listen and to be heard and that explicit is usually better than implicit. I always try to work hard but above all work smart. My past attempts to open businesses have shown me that direction is usually more important than speed in the many facets of life.

My main areas of interest include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Optimization and Decision-Making Algorithms
- Automation and AI Agents
- Parallel Computing and Distributed Systems
- Big Compute Solutions (rather than just big data)
